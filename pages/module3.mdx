## 🎥 STRUCTURE & FLOW OF THE VIDEO

### 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

🎯 *Goal:* Grab attention with a simple real-world example.

{/* Script example */}
> “Imagine a farmer in Kerala has 100 kg of turmeric.  
> How does it reach a shop in Delhi? Or even a buyer in Dubai?  
> That journey — from farm to consumer — is what agro trade is all about, and it’s simpler than you think.”

{/* Visual tip */}
- Show **animated arrows from farm → warehouse → local market → exporter → international buyer**

---

### 2️⃣ What is Trade? (0:45 – 1:45)

🎯 *Goal:* Simplify the concept using everyday language.

{/* Script idea */}
> “Trade is just the exchange of products for money.  
> In agro trade, it’s buying and selling crops, spices, fruits, and other agricultural products.  
> You can trade inside your country (domestic) or outside (international).”

{/* Interactive note */}
- Ask the viewer: “Think of the last fruit or spice you bought — that’s part of trade too!”

---

### 3️⃣ Domestic Trade Explained (1:45 – 3:00)

🎯 *Goal:* Explain local trade clearly.

**Key points:**

- Farmers sell to local traders or mandis  
- Traders may supply retailers, wholesalers, or processing companies  
- Pricing depends on supply, demand, quality, and local transport  
- Example: Turmeric from Erode → Chennai → retail stores in other cities

{/* Visual Tip */}
- Map of India showing major domestic trade routes  
- Use icons for farmer, trader, warehouse, retailer

{/* Action */}
- Ask viewers to pick one product from their region and trace **how it reaches nearby cities**

---

### 4️⃣ International Trade Explained (3:00 – 4:30)

🎯 *Goal:* Introduce exports in a beginner-friendly way.

**Key points:**

- Some products have more demand abroad (spices, pulses, coffee, herbs)  
- Export flow: Farmer → Trader → Exporter → Shipping → Importer → Foreign Buyer → Consumer  
- Factors affecting international trade: quality, certifications, logistics, payment methods  
- Example: Cardamom from India → Middle East or Europe

{/* Visual Tip */}
- Animated line map showing Indian port → Dubai → European warehouse

{/* Action */}
- Ask learners to **research one product** they like and find a country that imports it from India

### 5️⃣ Domestic vs International — Comparison (4:30 – 5:30)

🎯 *Goal:* Help learners see the pros and cons.

| Aspect           | Domestic Trade         | International Trade                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Complexity       | Simple               | More rules & documentation                 |
| Market           | India (1.4B consumers) | Global                                     |
| Payments         | Quick                | Bank transfers, LC, etc.                   |
| Documentation    | Minimal              | IEC, invoice, customs docs, certifications |
| Profit Potential | Moderate             | Higher, but more risk                      |

{/* Interactive Note */}
- Ask viewers to think: “Which path suits my product and capacity?”

### 6️⃣ Who’s Involved in the Trade Chain (5:30 – 6:30)

🎯 *Goal:* Identify key players and roles.

- Farmer / Producer  
- Trader / Aggregator

### 7️⃣ Why This Understanding Matters (6:30 – 7:15)

🎯 *Goal:* Show practical relevance.

- Knowing trade flow helps in deciding:  
  - Which products to start with  
  - Which markets to target first  
  - How to calculate costs and profit  
- Makes the learner think like a trader, not just a learner

{/* Script Tip */}
> “Even if you start small in domestic trade, understanding international trade will help you plan bigger moves later.”

### 8️⃣ Call to Action / Task (7:15 – 7:45)

- Learners create a **mini trade map** for one product:  
  - Indicate if it’s mostly domestic or exported
