## 🎥 STRUCTURE & FLOW OF THE VIDEO

### 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

🎯 _Goal:_ Grab attention with a relatable example

{/* Script idea */}

> “Let’s say you have 50 kg of turmeric. You want to sell it in India.  
> Do you go to a local shop? A wholesaler? Or online?  
> In this video, I’ll show you exactly how domestic trade works — step by step — so you can start trading confidently today.”

{/* Visual tip */}

- Animation: farmer → local trader → city markets → consumer

---

### 2️⃣ What is Domestic Trade? (0:45 – 1:30)

🎯 _Goal:_ Simplify concept

- Domestic trade = buying & selling products **within India**
- Key channels: local mandi, wholesalers, retailers, online marketplaces
- Pricing depends on: supply, demand, quality, season, logistics

{/* Example */}

> “Turmeric from Erode can go to Chennai, Bangalore, or Delhi. Each city has different demand and price — that’s domestic trading in action.”

---

### 3️⃣ Finding Buyers & Suppliers (1:30 – 3:00)

🎯 _Goal:_ Teach practical ways to connect

**Options:**

- **Local Mandi / Market:** Farmers sell to aggregators or traders
- **Wholesalers & Retailers:** Contact shops or distributors directly
- **Online Platforms:** IndiaMART, TradeIndia, OBAOL (community)
- **Direct Networking:** Farmer groups, cooperatives, trade fairs

{/* Action for learners */}

- List **3 potential buyers or suppliers** in their region
- Encourage visiting local markets or calling small traders

{/* Visual Tip */}

- Screenshot of online platform & icons for each method

---

### 4️⃣ Quality Checks & Packaging (3:00 – 4:00)

🎯 _Goal:_ Show importance of product readiness

- Clean, properly graded, and correctly packaged products attract better buyers
- Example: turmeric in small vacuum packs vs loose bulk → different price points
- Labeling & basic hygiene standards matter

{/* Action */}

- Check one product locally and note packaging & sale method

---

### 5️⃣ Basic Domestic Documentation (4:00 – 5:00)

🎯 _Goal:_ Introduce minimal paperwork

- Invoice / Bill of Supply (for GST registered traders)
- Transport documents if moving between states (waybill / e-way bill)
- Optional: maintain simple records if selling online

{/* Action */}

- Note down documents needed for a small transaction locally

---

### 6️⃣ Calculating Cost & Profit (5:00 – 6:00)

🎯 _Goal:_ Teach basic business calculation

**Step-by-step example:**

1. Purchase price from farmer: ₹100/kg
2. Transport + labor: ₹10/kg
3. Packaging: ₹5/kg
4. Selling price to city market trader: ₹130/kg
5. Profit = Selling Price – (Purchase + Costs) = ₹15/kg

{/* Action */}

- Pick one product and calculate **rough domestic profit** using local numbers

---

### 7️⃣ Actionable Task / Call to Action (6:00 – 6:30)

- Pick **one local product** and:
  1. Identify at least 1 buyer
  2. Check price in local market
  3. Calculate rough cost & profit

{/* Note */}

> “Even if you don’t make a sale today, you now know how to evaluate a product and see if it’s worth trading.”
