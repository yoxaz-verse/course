## Video Structure & Script

### 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

> “You’ve researched international markets and trade volumes, but how do you know **which product to sell**?  
> Choosing the wrong product can lead to low profits or wasted effort.  
> In this video, we’ll learn **how to evaluate product potential** so you pick the right opportunities.”

### 2️⃣ What Makes a Product Good for Export (0:45 – 2:00)

> “A good export product usually has:
>
> - **High demand internationally** — buyers need it consistently
> - **Long shelf life or good storage** — easy to ship
> - **Price stability** — avoids huge fluctuations that hurt profit
> - **Manageable logistics** — packaging, transport, and handling are feasible

> Example: Cardamom, turmeric, and dry chilies often meet these criteria for India.”

{/* Action */}

- List **3 products** that meet these criteria in your region

{/* Visual */}

- Animated checklist: Demand ✅ Shelf Life ✅ Price Stability ✅ Logistics ✅

### 3️⃣ When Not to Export (2:00 – 3:00)

> “Avoid exporting products when:
>
> - **Low profit margin** — costs outweigh gains
> - **High logistics risk** — perishable, fragile, or heavy items
> - **Oversupply in target market** — too much competition
> - **Regulatory challenges** — restrictions, certifications, or compliance hurdles

> Recognizing these risks saves time and money.”

{/* Action */}

- Note **one product in your region** that is risky to export and why

### 4️⃣ Choosing Products Based on Location & Capacity (3:00 – 3:45)

> “Even a great product can fail if it doesn’t match your capacity:
>
> - Are you near production centers?
> - Can you handle packaging and transport?
> - Do you have access to buyers or communities?

> Always align product choice with your **location, skills, and logistics capability**.”

{/* Action */}

- Map **your capacity** and **choose products** that suit it

{/* Visual */}

- Map animation showing warehouse location → farm → export hub → buyer

### 5️⃣ Call to Action / Task (3:45 – 4:15)

- Create a **“Product Opportunity Sheet”** with columns:
  - Product Name
  - Export Potential (High/Medium/Low)
  - Key Markets
  - Challenges / Risks
- List **3 products** and fill in the sheet
