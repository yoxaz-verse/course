## Video Structure & Script

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hook (0:00 ‚Äì 0:45)

> ‚ÄúWhy does turmeric cost ‚Çπ140/kg in India but $3/kg in Dubai?  
> Prices change daily, and global factors play a big role.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Global Pricing Works (0:45 ‚Äì 2:00)

> ‚ÄúGlobal commodity prices are determined by supply, demand, and trade flows.
>
> - When supply exceeds demand, prices drop
> - When demand exceeds supply, prices rise  
>   Exporters and importers watch these trends closely to decide when and how much to trade.‚Äù

{/* Action */}

- Pick one product and note **its current price in India and the top importing country**

{/* Visual */}

- Animated scale showing supply vs demand affecting prices

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Factors Influencing Prices (2:00 ‚Äì 3:00)

> ‚ÄúKey factors that influence agro prices:
>
> - **Climate:** Bad weather reduces harvest ‚Üí prices rise
> - **Demand:** Festivals, seasonal trends, or market demand spikes
> - **Logistics:** Transport delays, port congestion, and costs
> - **Currency fluctuations:** Exchange rates impact import/export costs

> Example: A poor turmeric harvest in India raises prices in importing countries.‚Äù

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How One Country‚Äôs Harvest Affects Another‚Äôs Import Price (3:00 ‚Äì 3:45)

> ‚ÄúIf India produces less turmeric due to rain shortage, Dubai importers will face higher prices.  
> Conversely, a bumper crop in India can lower import costs globally.  
> Understanding this **link helps you anticipate market movements and plan trade**.‚Äù

{/* Action */}

- Track a recent harvest report and see how it affected export prices

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Commodity Cycles (3:45 ‚Äì 4:30)

> ‚ÄúAgro commodities follow cycles:
>
> - Planting ‚Üí Harvest ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Price Adjustment ‚Üí Next Planting  
>   Experienced traders study these cycles to **plan when to buy and sell**, maximizing profit while reducing risk.‚Äù

{/* Action */}

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Call to Action / Task (4:30 ‚Äì 5:00)

- Compare the **current price of one agro product** in India vs a top importing country
- Note the **factors affecting the price difference** (climate, logistics, demand, currency)
- Draw a **commodity cycle** to visualize trends for future trades

{/* Visual */}
