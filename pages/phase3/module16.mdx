# Module 16: Why Global Trade Exists

**Title suggestion:**  
👉 _“Why Countries Trade: Understanding the Global Agro Market”_

---

## 🎯 Module Objective

By the end of this video, learners will:

1. Understand why countries engage in international trade
2. Learn how surplus and demand create export opportunities
3. See how farmers, traders, and consumers connect globally
4. Practice researching which countries import a specific agro product

## Video Structure & Script

### 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

> “Why does India export spices, but import wheat?  
> Why do countries trade at all?  
> In this video, we’ll explore the **reasons behind global trade** and how it connects farmers, traders, and consumers worldwide.”

{/* Visual */}

- Animated globe with arrows showing products moving between countries

---

### 2️⃣ Why Countries Trade (0:45 – 2:00)

> “Countries trade because they **don’t produce everything themselves**, or they produce more than they need.  
> Example: India produces more spices than it consumes — this creates an opportunity to **export surplus**.  
> Meanwhile, a country with less spice production will import to meet its demand.

> Trade allows each country to focus on **what they do best** while getting access to other products they need.”

{/* Action */}

- Pick a product grown in your region and identify **why India exports it**

{/* Visual */}

- Split-screen: India with surplus spices → exporting; another country → importing

---

### 3️⃣ How Trade Balances Shortages and Surpluses (2:00 – 3:00)

> “Surplus in one country and shortage in another is the **basic principle of global trade**.  
> Example: India exports turmeric to countries that don’t grow enough locally.  
> This helps balance supply globally, **keeps prices stable**, and ensures everyone gets the products they need.”

{/* Action */}

- Look up **global production vs consumption** for one agro product (e.g., turmeric or cardamom)

{/* Visual */}

- Animated balance scale showing surplus on one side, shortage on the other

---

### 4️⃣ How Consumers, Farmers & Traders Form the Global Value Chain (3:00 – 4:00)

> “Global trade is a **value chain**:
>
> - Farmers produce the crop
> - Traders connect farmers to buyers locally and internationally
> - Consumers get the final product

> Without any link in this chain, the system would break. Traders **create opportunities** by matching surplus with demand worldwide.”

{/* Action */}

- Draw a **simple value chain** for one agro product from farm → trader → consumer

{/* Visual */}

- Flowchart animation: Farm → Trader → Export → Import → Consumer

---

### 5️⃣ Call to Action / Task (4:00 – 4:30)

- Pick **one agro product** you are interested in
- Use a **trade data website** (like DGFT or ITC Trade Map) to find the **top importing countries**
- Note why they import and how India supplies them

{/* Visual */}

- Animated world map with arrows showing product export flows
