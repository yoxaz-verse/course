{/* Script */}

> “Imagine you just sold 100 kg of cardamom to a buyer overseas. But then there’s confusion — who pays for transport, who handles insurance, and when will the money arrive? That’s where Incoterms and payment terms come in — they make trading smooth and safe.”

{/* Visual */}

### 3️⃣ Most Common Incoterms in Agro Trade (1:45 – 3:00)

| Incoterm                       | Who handles transport | Who pays insurance | Notes                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| EXW (Ex-Works)                 | Buyer                 | Buyer              | Seller only delivers at warehouse/farm      |
| FOB (Free on Board)            | Seller to port        | Buyer              | Seller responsible till port                |
| CIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) | Seller to port        | Seller             | Seller pays transport & insurance till port |
| DAP (Delivered at Place)       | Seller                | Seller             | Seller delivers to agreed destination       |

{/* Tip */}

- Use one product example (e.g., turmeric) to show responsibility differences

{/* Action */}

- Pick one Incoterm and **draw a flow diagram** with seller/buyer responsibilities

### 4️⃣ Payment Terms (3:00 – 4:00)

{/* Script */}

- **Advance Payment:** Buyer pays before shipment; low risk for seller
- **LC (Letter of Credit):** Bank guarantees payment once documents meet conditions
- **DP (Documents against Payment):** Buyer pays at port to receive documents
- **DA (Documents against Acceptance):** Payment due later; higher risk

{/* Visual */}

- Flow arrows: buyer → bank → seller (LC), buyer → seller (Advance)

{/* Action */}

- Note which payment term you’d choose for domestic vs international sales

---

### 5️⃣ How to Choose Terms (4:00 – 5:00)

{/* Script */}

- Domestic trade → advance or simple invoice payment
- Export → depends on buyer relationship, trust, and country
- Risk vs profit: safer terms reduce risk but may slightly reduce profit
- Example: FOB safer than EXW if buyer is inexperienced

{/* Action */}

- Make a **quick table**:

| Product | Buyer Type | Suggested Incoterm | Suggested Payment Term |

---

### 6️⃣ Why This Matters (5:00 – 5:45)

{/* Script */}

- Misunderstanding terms → disputes, delayed payments, or losses
- Correct terms = professional credibility + smoother business

> “Even one wrong term in a contract can create confusion. Learning this early saves money and builds trust with buyers.”

---

### 7️⃣ Call to Action / Task (5:45 – 6:15)

- Pick one product and decide:
  1. Domestic or export?
  2. Suitable Incoterm
  3. Payment term
