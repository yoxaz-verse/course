> ‚ÄúStep 1: Calculate your total cost ‚Äî product cost, packaging, transport, GST, and any other taxes.  
> Step 2: Add your profit margin based on effort, quantity, and deal size ‚Äî don‚Äôt be greedy. For example:  
> - For a 100 kg deal, if the product cost is ‚Çπ100/kg, a reasonable margin might be ‚Çπ5‚Äì10/kg depending on effort.  
> Step 3: Include terms clearly ‚Äî quantity, price, delivery timeline, payment method, Incoterms  
> Step 4: Format professionally ‚Äî Excel or Word sheet works fine

> Example: For 100 kg turmeric:  
> - Product cost: ‚Çπ100/kg  
> - Transport + packaging: ‚Çπ10/kg  
> - GST extra  
> - Profit: ‚Çπ5/kg  
> **Quoted price:** ‚Çπ115/kg + GST + transport  
>
> This ensures a fair profit without overpricing, and your quotation is transparent.‚Äù
