🎯 _Goal:_ Catch attention fast. Make them curious and emotionally invested.

{/* Example Script Flow */}

> “Have you ever wondered where the cardamom you see in Dubai shops actually comes from?  
> Or how a small farmer in Kerala ends up supplying to someone sitting in Canada?  
> That’s the power of agro trading — and in this series, I’m going to show you how it works, step by step.”

### 2️⃣ What is Agro Trade? (1:00 – 2:30)

🎯 _Goal:_ Simplify the concept using relatable examples.

{/* Flow */}

- Explain in one line:

  > “Agro trading is simply buying and selling agricultural products — like spices, pulses, grains, and fruits — between farmers, traders, and markets, both inside India and internationally.”

- Show the **chain visually:**  
  Farmer → Trader → Wholesaler → Exporter → Importer → Buyer → Consumer

- Give one **real-life example:**
  > “For example, if you buy turmeric from Erode and sell it to a company in Delhi or Dubai — you’re doing agro trade.”

{/* Interactive */}

> “Have you ever helped your family sell produce or products? Then you’ve already done a part of agro trading.”

### 3️⃣ Why Agro Trading Matters (2:30 – 4:00)

🎯 _Goal:_ Build context and motivation.

**Points to cover:**

- India = 1.4 billion people → huge local demand
- One of the world’s largest producers and exporters of agro goods
- Agro industry = backbone of the Indian economy
- Big opportunity for youth to enter — not just farmers, but anyone who wants to trade

{/* Script Example */}

> “India’s agro industry isn’t just about farming — it’s a massive business network.  
> There are people who grow, people who store, people who sell, and people who export.  
> And the truth is — if you understand how this system works, you can be part of it — even without owning a farm.”

{/* Emotional Touch */}

> “Our farmers work hard to grow world-class products.  
> Our job as traders is to make sure those products reach the right buyers, at the right price.”
