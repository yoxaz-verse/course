### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Where to Find Market Prices & Trends (2:00 ‚Äì 3:30)

> ‚ÄúKnowing the right price is key. You don‚Äôt want to underprice or overprice.  
> **Domestic prices:** Check local mandis, online marketplaces, and trade associations.  
> **International prices:** Check exporter portals, APEDA, Trade Map, and global indexes.
>
> And very soon, **OBAOL Supreme** will make this even easier ‚Äî you‚Äôll be able to see **live, verified market prices for any agro product**, no matter which region you‚Äôre in.  
> That means no more guessing, no more fake prices ‚Äî just transparent, real-time market price which you can purchase directly.
>
> Track prices over a week or month to see trends. Prices change with season, demand, and product quality.‚Äù

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How to Decide Which Product to Trade (3:30 ‚Äì 4:30)

> ‚ÄúNot every product is worth trading. Ask yourself:
>
> 1. Is there demand?
> 2. Can I source it at a good cost?
> 3. Is shipping and storage feasible?
> 4. Does it have a good profit margin?

> Start small. Test one or two products before scaling up. This reduces risk and helps you learn the market faster.‚Äù

{/* Action */}

- Select **one product** they want to focus on and check its demand, cost, and potential profit

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Product Seasonality, Quality Grades & Shelf Life (4:30 ‚Äì 5:45)

> ‚ÄúDifferent products have different seasons, quality levels, and shelf life.  
> For example:
>
> - Cardamom: peak harvest season affects price; quality grades A, B, or C affect profit
> - Turmeric: shelf life matters for shipping internationally; packaging is crucial

> Knowing seasonality helps you buy at the right time and sell at maximum profit. Quality grading ensures buyers trust your product. And understanding shelf life prevents losses during storage or shipment.‚Äù

{/* Action */}

- Create a **simple product sheet**: Product name, peak season, grades, shelf life, current price
