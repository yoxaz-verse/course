### 🇮🇳 Domestic Payment Terms (0:40 – 2:00)

> “Domestic trade runs on speed + trust:
>
> - **Advance / Partial Advance:** Safest for new deals.
> - **Cash on Delivery (COD):** Good for small/local trades.
> - **Credit (7–30 days):** Use only with trusted partners.”

**💡 Tip:** Always issue an **invoice** and keep **proof of payment**, even locally.

---

### 🌍 International Payment Terms (2:00 – 4:00)

> “Global deals need structured safeguards:
>
> - **Advance Payment:** Simple but buyer-risky.
> - **Letter of Credit (LC):** Bank-backed — safest for exporters.
> - **Documents against Payment (DP):** Buyer pays on seeing docs.
> - **Documents against Acceptance (DA):** Buyer promises later payment — riskier.”

### 🧮 Choosing the Right Method (4:00 – 4:45)

> “Start with **Advance** or **LC** for first orders.  
> Move to **DP / DA** only after trust builds.”

| New Buyer       | Domestic         | Advance        | Low risk       |
| Repeat Buyer    | Gulf             | LC             | Secure payment |
| Trusted Partner | Neighbor country | DP             | Faster release |
