### ü™ù Hook (0:00 ‚Äì 0:40)

> ‚ÄúMost traders confuse _payment terms_ with _Incoterms._  
> One decides **when money moves**, the other decides **who takes responsibility** for the goods.‚Äù

**üí° Visual Idea:** Split-screen ‚Äî **üí∞ Payment** on left, **üö¢ Delivery** on right.

### üìò Main Concept (0:40 ‚Äì 2:30)

> ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs simplify:
>
> - **Incoterms = Who handles the goods, shipping, and risk.**
> - **Payment Terms = When and how money is paid.**
>
> Example: _You sell turmeric under FOB Chennai + LC Payment._  
>  ‚Ä¢ FOB ‚Üí you handle goods until port.  
>  ‚Ä¢ LC ‚Üí buyer‚Äôs bank pays once documents are verified.‚Äù

**üí° Visual:** Flowchart showing  
‚ÄúGoods Movement (Incoterms)‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúMoney Flow (Payment Terms)‚Äù.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake (2:30 ‚Äì 3:15)

> If your term is CIF, you still pay freight + insurance ‚Äî even after sale!‚Äù

**‚úÖ Action Task:**  
Write down one real or sample deal.  
List its **Incoterm** and **Payment Term** side-by-side.
