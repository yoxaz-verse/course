## 🎥 STRUCTURE & FLOW OF THE VIDEO

### 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

🎯 _Goal:_ Grab attention with scale + opportunity.

{/* Script example */}

> “Did you know India produces more than 2.5 billion tons of crops every year?  
> Yet many farmers and traders struggle to find the right buyers at the right price.  
> Imagine if you could understand the system and use it to connect farmers with markets — you could earn, and help the system grow.”

{/* Tip */}

- Use **visual graphics or animated numbers** to show scale (tons produced, billion-dollar export markets, etc.)

---

### 2️⃣ Overview of India’s Agro Industry (0:45 – 2:00)

🎯 _Goal:_ Give the learner a bird’s-eye view of the industry.

- Agriculture’s contribution to India’s GDP
- Key sectors: grains, pulses, spices, fruits, vegetables, oilseeds, tea, coffee, etc.
- India’s position globally in each category (e.g., “#1 producer of spices, #2 in rice exports”)

{/* Script idea */}

> “India isn’t just big in population; we’re big in production. Spices, rice, pulses, and even herbal products — India leads globally in many of these.”

{/* Visual tip */}

- Use **maps or charts** highlighting major production regions

---

### 3️⃣ Key Products and Their Importance (2:00 – 3:30)

🎯 _Goal:_ Help learners connect with products they might trade.

- List high-demand products: turmeric, cardamom, pepper, pulses, grains, fruits
- Explain why some are mostly domestic and some are mostly exported
- Include seasonality notes: which months crops are harvested

{/* Action for learners */}

> Ask viewers to **pick 3 products from their region** and note if they’re mostly consumed locally or exported

---

### 4️⃣ Opportunities in Domestic Market (3:30 – 4:30)

🎯 _Goal:_ Make learners understand that India itself is a huge trading market.

- India = 1.4B people → massive domestic demand
- Retail chains, wholesalers, e-commerce platforms — plenty of buyers
- Short video example: “A small turmeric trader in Erode can sell to 5+ cities in India without exporting”

{/* Action */}

- Learners list **1 product** they see being sold in their city or nearby markets that could be traded across India

---

### 5️⃣ Opportunities in Export Market (4:30 – 5:30)

🎯 _Goal:_ Introduce international potential in simple terms.

- India exports to multiple countries: spices to Middle East, rice to Africa, pulses to Europe
- Mention that international trade is slightly more complex, but huge opportunities exist
- Key idea: first understand your product and domestic market, then explore exports

{/* Action */}

- Learners look up **top 1–2 importing countries** for one product they picked earlier (APEDA website or Trade Map)

---

### 6️⃣ Why Understanding This is Important (5:30 – 6:30)

🎯 _Goal:_ Connect knowledge to action — show them the value of this understanding.

- Understanding production regions, seasons, and demand helps decide:
  - Which product to start with
  - Which markets to target
  - How to plan logistics and pricing

{/* Script idea */}

> “Before you even make a single trade, knowing where your product comes from and who wants it is half the battle won.”

---

### 7️⃣ Call to Action / Interactive Task (6:30 – 7:00)

- Ask learners to create a **small table**:

| Product | Local Consumption or Export | Key Season | Possible Market |

- They can fill this for 2–3 products from their region
- Tell them: _“Keep this table. We’ll use it in the next video when we learn how to connect with buyers.”_
