# 🎬 Module 6C — Incoterms in Agro Trade with Real Examples

## 🎯 Objective

Master major **Incoterms** through real-world agro scenarios.

---

### 🪝 Hook (0:00 – 0:40)

> “Who pays shipping? Who handles insurance?  
> That’s where **Incoterms** make everything clear.”

**💡 Visual:** Container loading → “Who’s responsible?” labels.

---

### 🚚 Domestic Incoterms (0:40 – 2:00)

> “Inside India, keep it simple:
>
> - **EXW (Ex-Works):** Buyer picks up from your warehouse.
> - **DAP (Delivered at Place):** You deliver to buyer’s door.”

**💡 Visual:** Truck moving from farmer → trader → buyer.

---

### 🚢 International Incoterms (2:00 – 4:00)

> “For exports, remember the big four:
>
> - **FOB (Free on Board):** Seller covers till port.
> - **CFR (Cost & Freight):** Seller pays shipping only.
> - **CIF (Cost, Insurance & Freight):** Seller pays shipping + insurance.
> - **DAP (Delivered at Place):** Seller handles the entire journey.”

**Example Story:**  
“You sell turmeric FOB Chennai to Dubai:  
You pay till port loading.  
CIF Dubai means you also cover freight + insurance.”

**💡 Visual:** Cargo path: warehouse → port → ship → destination;  
cost & risk labels shift at each stage.
