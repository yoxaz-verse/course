# Module 5E: Air Transport & Storage Types

**🎬 Title:**  
👉 _“Air Shipping & Storage for Agro Products: Fast & Safe”_

---

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this video, learners will:

1. Understand air transport options for agro exports
2. Learn types of cargo planes and their uses
3. Know how to package and handle products for air
4. Explore storage types for agro products (cold storage, warehouses, silos)

---

## 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

> “Some agro products like high-value spices or perishable seeds need to reach buyers quickly.  
> Air transport is fast, but it comes with its own rules.  
> In this video, we’ll explore air freight options and storage types to keep your products safe.”

**💡 Visual:** Cargo plane taking off from an Indian airport, animated product icons in cargo hold.

## 2️⃣ How Air Transport Works (0:45 – 1:30)

> “Air transport moves goods quickly from airport to airport:
>
> 1. **Booking:** Reserve space with airline cargo or freight forwarder
> 2. **Packing:** Products packed in air-approved cartons or pallets
> 3. **Transport:** Loaded into cargo planes for export
> 4. **Delivery:** Cleared at destination airport and transported to buyer”

**✅ Action:** Draw a flowchart for your product’s air shipment from warehouse → airport → buyer.

**💡 Visual:** Animated plane moving across map with package icons.

## 3️⃣ Types of Air Cargo & Planes (1:30 – 2:30)

| Type                              | Use Case                                                     | Notes                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **General Cargo**                 | Spices, packaged seeds, packaged pulses                      | Most common for agro exports    |
| **Perishable / Reefer Cargo**     | Fresh herbs, seeds, or spices needing controlled temperature | Maintains quality during flight |
| **Express / Courier Cargo**       | Small high-value shipments                                   | Faster but costly               |
| **Passenger Aircraft Cargo Hold** | Small-scale exports                                          | Usually limited weight and size |

**✅ Action:** Identify which type of air cargo suits your product.

## 4️⃣ Packaging & Handling for Air (2:30 – 3:45)

> “Air cargo needs strong and lightweight packaging:
>
> - Use cartons or crates suitable for air transport
> - Label for handling instructions: fragile, keep upright, temperature-sensitive
> - Secure pallets with straps or shrink wrap
> - Avoid overpacking to reduce weight and cost”

**✅ Action:** Plan a packaging layout for your air shipment.

**💡 Visual:** Animated packages being palletized, labeled, and loaded onto cargo plane.

## 5️⃣ Storage Types for Agro Products (3:45 – 5:00)

| Storage Type                               | Use Case                              | Key Tip                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold Storage / Refrigerated Warehouses** | Perishable or heat-sensitive products | Maintain recommended temperature                    |
| **Dry Warehouses**                         | Spices, grains, pulses                | Keep moisture < 12% to avoid spoilage               |
| **Silos / Bulk Storage**                   | Large quantities of grains or powders | Ensure ventilation and pest control                 |
| **On-farm Storage**                        | Short-term storage for harvesting     | Use clean, ventilated area to prevent contamination |

**✅ Action:** Decide which storage type fits your product before shipping.

## 6️⃣ Cost, Transit & Safety Considerations (5:00 – 5:45)

> “Air transport is fast but expensive. Key points:
>
> - **Transit Time:** 1–5 days depending on destination
> - **Cost:** Higher than sea or road; depends on weight, volume, and type
> - **Safety:** Proper packaging and labeling reduce damage risk”

**✅ Action:** Estimate cost and transit time for your product’s air shipment.

**💡 Visual:** Chart comparing air vs sea vs road cost and transit time.

## 7️⃣ Call to Action / Task (5:45 – 6:00)

- Choose **one product**
- Plan air shipment: cargo type, packaging, estimated cost
- Decide storage type pre- and post-shipment

**💡 Visual:** Animated checklist ticking off all steps.
