# Module 5A: Logistics, Transport & Storage — Overview

**🎬 Title:**  
👉 _“How Agro Products Move: From Farm to Market Safely”_

---

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this video, learners will:

1. Know the main modes of agro transport — Road, Rail, Sea, Air
2. Understand when each is used and why
3. Learn what kind of containers, wagons, and vehicles are used
4. Know the basic storage options after transport

---

## 1️⃣ Overview: How Agro Goods Move (0:00 – 1:00)

> “Every agro product — from turmeric to cardamom — travels through a logistics chain.  
> It might go by truck to a warehouse, by train to a port, by ship overseas, or even by air for express delivery.”

**💡 Visual:** Flow animation — Farm → Truck → Rail → Ship → Buyer.

## 2️⃣ Modes of Transport (1:00 – 3:00)

> “There are four main transport modes for agro trade — each has its own use case.”

| Mode     | Use Case                       | Cost   | Speed      | Best For          |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Road** | Short to medium distance       | 💰💰   | 🚚 Fast    | Local trade       |
| **Rail** | Bulk, long-distance inland     | 💰     | 🚄 Medium  | Grains, Maize  |
| **Sea**  | Exports, heavy volumes         | 💰     | 🚢 Slow    | Rice, spices      |
| **Air**  | High-value or perishable goods | 💰💰💰 | ✈️ Fastest | Cardamom, flowers |

**✅ Action:** Choose one product and match it with the best transport mode.

---

## 3️⃣ Containers, Wagons & Vehicles (3:00 – 4:00)

> “Each mode uses different carriers to keep goods safe and efficient.”

- **Road:** Open trucks, covered trucks, and refrigerated trucks for perishables.
- **Rail:** Covered wagons (BCN), high-capacity BOXN for dry goods, refrigerated rail containers for perishables.
- **Sea:** Standard 20ft & 40ft containers, reefers (temperature-controlled), bulk carriers for grains.
- **Air:** Cargo planes use Unit Load Devices (ULDs) — specialized containers for fragile or fresh produce.

**💡 Visual:** Icons or short clips of each transport type.

## 4️⃣ Storage Options (4:00 – 5:30)

> “Once goods reach the destination, storage matters as much as transport.”

- **Cold Storage:** For perishable goods (spices, fruits, seeds)
- **Dry Warehouses:** For grains, pulses, turmeric
- **Controlled Humidity Rooms:** For moisture-sensitive products like cardamom
- **Transit Warehousing:** Short-term holding during multi-step transport

**✅ Action:**  
List which type of storage suits your main product.

## 5️⃣ Summary (5:30 – 6:00)

| Topic           | Key Takeaway                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Transport Modes | Each fits a different distance & sensitivity |
| Containers      | Match type to your product                   |
| Storage         | Keeps product quality after delivery         |

> “Choosing the right mode and storage is what separates a smooth trade from a loss.  
> In the next videos — Modules **5B to 5E** — we’ll go deeper into each mode.”
