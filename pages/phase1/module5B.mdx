## 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

> “Imagine sending turmeric or cardamom 300 km to a buyer — which truck should you use?  
> How do you make sure it arrives safely, on time, and without losing quality?  
> In this video, we’ll explore how road transport works, step by step.”

**💡 Visual:** Animation of a truck moving from farm → warehouse → buyer.

## 2️⃣ How Road Transport Works (0:45 – 1:30)

> “Road transport is flexible and fast for short-to-medium distances.  
> It works in three main steps:
>
> 1. **Pickup:** From farm or warehouse
> 2. **Transport:** On highways or rural roads
> 3. **Delivery:** To buyer, wholesaler, or port”

**✅ Action:** Map a simple route for one product you plan to transport.

**💡 Visual:** Animated map showing pickup → highway → buyer.

## 3️⃣ Types of Trucks (1:30 – 3:00)

| Truck Type                | Use Case                      | Notes                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Open Truck / Tipper**   | Dry bulk, spices              | Goods must be covered with tarpaulin   |
| **Covered Truck**         | Sensitive dry goods           | Protects from rain/dust                |
| **Refrigerated / Reefer** | Perishables (cardamom, seeds) | Temp-controlled for freshness          |
| **Container Truck**       | For export or intercity bulk  | Standard 20ft/40ft container, lockable |

**✅ Action:** Choose the best truck type for your product and distance.

**💡 Visual:** Show 4 truck icons with product examples moving along a road.

## 4️⃣ Loading & Safety Tips (3:00 – 4:15)

> “Loading properly prevents damage and loss. Key tips:
>
> - Don’t overload trucks — respect weight limits
> - Stack carefully — heavier items at the bottom
> - Use cushioning for fragile products
> - Cover goods against rain, dust, or sunlight”

**✅ Action:** Sketch a simple loading plan for your product.

**💡 Visual:** Side-by-side: wrong loading vs correct loading animation.

## 5️⃣ Route Planning & Cost Factors (4:15 – 5:15)

> “Efficient routes save time and reduce cost:
>
> - Choose highways for speed, avoid bad roads for fragile goods
> - Check tolls, fuel stops, and delivery windows
> - Consider seasonal traffic, road conditions, and weather”

**✅ Action:** Write down the **fastest and safest route** for a sample shipment.

**💡 Visual:** Animated truck route map with checkpoints and cost indicators.

## 6️⃣ Summary & Takeaway (5:15 – 6:00)

| Topic        | Key Takeaway                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Truck Types  | Pick based on product, distance, and sensitivity |
| Loading      | Proper stacking & covering prevents losses       |
| Route & Cost | Plan efficiently to save time & money            |

> “Road transport is the backbone of domestic agro trade. Picking the right truck, loading correctly, and planning routes ensures your product arrives safe, on time, and profitable.”

**✅ Task:**  
Pick **one product** and create a **road transport plan**: truck type, loading method, route, and cost estimate.

---

**💡 Teaching Tip:**  
Use **real truck examples and animation** — learners should clearly see the difference between open trucks, covered trucks, and reefers.
