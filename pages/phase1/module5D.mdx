# Module 5D: Sea Transport & Container Types

**🎬 Title:**  
👉 _“Shipping Agro Products by Sea: Ships, Containers & Safety”_

---

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this video, learners will:

1. Understand sea transport options for agro products
2. Learn types of ships and containers
3. Know how to load, secure, and protect goods
4. Compare costs, transit times, and suitability for different products

## 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

> “If you want to export turmeric, cardamom, or pulses internationally, sea transport is often the cheapest option.  
> But do you know which type of ship or container to choose, or how to protect your cargo during a long voyage? Let’s break it down.”

**💡 Visual:** Animated cargo ship leaving an Indian port with containers labeled “Agro Products.”

---

## 2️⃣ How Sea Transport Works (0:45 – 1:30)

> “Sea transport involves moving goods from port to port:
>
> 1. **Booking:** Reserve container space on a vessel
> 2. **Loading:** Goods are packed into containers at the warehouse or port
> 3. **Transport:** Ship moves through designated shipping lanes
> 4. **Unloading & Delivery:** Container reaches buyer’s port and cleared via customs”

**✅ Action:** Draw a simple flow chart of your product’s sea shipment from warehouse → port → buyer.

**💡 Visual:** Animated ship moving from India → importing country with container stacks.

## 3️⃣ Types of Ships (1:30 – 2:30)

| Ship Type                      | Use Case                          | Notes                            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Container Ship**             | Standard exports in containers    | Most common for agro products    |
| **Bulk Carrier**               | Loose bulk cargo (grains, pulses) | Cost-effective for high volume   |
| **Refrigerated / Reefer Ship** | Perishables like spices or seeds  | Maintains controlled temperature |
| **Roll-on / Roll-off (RoRo)**  | Vehicles & special equipment      | Rare for agro products           |

**✅ Action:** Choose the appropriate ship type for your product and shipment volume.

**💡 Visual:** Animated ships with labels and cargo types.

## 4️⃣ Container Types & Uses (2:30 – 3:45)

| Container Type            | Use Case                     | Notes                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Standard 20ft / 40ft**  | General agro products        | Most commonly used            |
| **High Cube**             | Extra height for bulky goods | Slightly higher cost          |
| **Refrigerated / Reefer** | Sensitive spices or seeds    | Temperature-controlled        |
| **Open Top / Flat Rack**  | Odd-sized items              | Rarely used for agro products |

**✅ Action:** Decide which container type fits your product and quantity.

**💡 Visual:** Animated containers being loaded onto a ship with product icons.

## 5️⃣ Loading, Securing & Safety Tips (3:45 – 4:45)

> “Proper loading is crucial:
>
> - Stack containers safely to prevent shifting
> - Use pallets for sacks or boxes
> - Protect from moisture using liners or tarpaulins
> - Check for fumigation or customs requirements for export”

**✅ Action:** Create a **loading & protection plan** for your container shipment.

**💡 Visual:** Before/after animation of poorly vs properly loaded containers.

## 6️⃣ Cost, Transit Time & Route Considerations (4:45 – 5:30)

> “Sea transport is cost-effective but slower than air:
>
> - **Transit Time:** 20–40 days depending on destination
> - **Cost Factors:** Freight rates, fuel, port charges, container type
> - Compare with air for high-value or perishable products”

**✅ Action:** Note the estimated cost and transit time for your product’s target market.

**💡 Visual:** Animated chart comparing sea vs air transport costs and time.

## 7️⃣ Summary & Takeaway (5:30 – 6:00)

| Topic            | Key Takeaway                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Ship Types       | Pick based on product, volume, and perishability  |
| Container Types  | Match container to product needs and export rules |
| Loading & Safety | Proper packing prevents damage and customs issues |
| Cost & Transit   | Plan for cost, transit time, and market timing    |

> “Sea transport is essential for international trade. Choosing the right ship, container, and loading method ensures your agro products arrive safely and cost-effectively.”

**✅ Task:**  
Plan a sea shipment for one product: choose **ship type, container type, loading method, and estimate transit time/cost**.

---

**💡 Teaching Tip:**  
Use **animated container stacks and ships** — show how containers are loaded, secured, and moved across ports. Visuals help learners grasp large-scale logistics.
