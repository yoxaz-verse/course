## Content Flow

### 1️⃣ Hook (0:00 – 0:45)

{/* Script */}
> “You have your turmeric ready to sell. But how do you get it to Delhi or even Dubai without spoiling it? In this video, we’ll break down the simple logistics system behind agro trade — so your products always reach buyers in perfect condition.”

{/* Visual */}
- Animated turmeric moving in trucks, trains, and ships

---

### 2️⃣ Why Logistics Matters (0:45 – 1:30)

{/* Script */}
- Poor handling = product loss, reduced price, unhappy buyers  
- Efficient logistics = more profit, repeat buyers, easier scaling  

> “Even if your product is high-quality, it doesn’t matter if it reaches the buyer damaged or late. That’s why logistics is a critical part of trade.”

### 3️⃣ Types of Transport (1:30 – 3:00)

| Transport Type     | Best for                                      | Key Notes                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Road (Truck/Tempo) | Most domestic products, short-medium distance | Flexible, door-to-door delivery      |
| Rail               | Bulk domestic products, long-distance         | Cost-effective, slower               |
| Sea / Ship         | International exports, large quantities       | Cheapest for bulk, slow, needs ports |
| Air                | Perishable, high-value exports                | Fastest but expensive                |

{/* Action */}
- Pick **one product** and decide which transport method makes sense

{/* Visual */}
- Icons for each transport mode with arrows showing movement

---

### 4️⃣ Storage & Handling (3:00 – 4:00)

{/* Script */}
- Proper drying, cleaning, grading  
- Packaging according to product type (bulk, vacuum, bags)  
- Storage temperature and humidity (spices, grains, perishable goods)

{/* Action */}
- Check how a product in your local market is stored/packed and note observations

---

### 5️⃣ Costs & Planning (4:00 – 5:00)

{/* Script */}
- Transport cost = distance + weight + mode + packaging  
- Storage cost = warehouse fees, temperature control, insurance  

**Example:**  
- 100 kg turmeric → Truck ₹2000, Packaging ₹500 → Total ₹2500

{/* Action */}
- Calculate rough transport cost for one product from your area

{/* Visual */}
- Table/chart showing cost breakdown

---

### 6️⃣ Domestic vs International Consideration (5:00 – 5:45)

{/* Script */}
- Domestic: Trucks/rail, short-term storage  
- International: Export packaging, containers, shipping schedules, customs documentation  
> “Understanding logistics early helps you plan costs and avoid surprises.”

{/* Action */}
- Note **one additional step** if sending the same product abroad (port delivery, container booking)

---

### 7️⃣ Call to Action / Task (5:45 – 6:15)

- Pick one product and:  
  1. Decide the best transport method locally  
  2. Estimate cost and time  
  3. Check local storage/packaging  

> “These small steps help you see how your product flows — the foundation for all future trades.”
